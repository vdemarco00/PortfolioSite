      <h2>A time trial 3D platforming game developed for the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion.</h2>
      <h3>
        The Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion commissioned SNHU's Inkwell Game Studio to create a 
        competitive game themed around the pavilion for guests at the pavilion to playing during some 
        of their events.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        We created a 3D platformer game where players will individually race through a course themed around the 
        pavilion, and will all compete for the fastest time to the finish line. The game is played in a web browser 
        and communicates with a leaderboard server, so players and submit their scores and compare theirs to other player scores.
